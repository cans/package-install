----------------

Assume you have two roles, `first_role` and `second_roles`, each of
which defines a variable that contains a list of packages to install,
let say `first_role_packages` and `second_role_packages`, respectively.
You can then to use this role, start by assiging the
`pkg_install_packages` variable with the concatenation of both list.
Then just call the role.

    - hosts: servers
      vars:
        pkg_install_packages: "{{ first_role_packages + second_role_packages }}"
      roles:
        - { role: cans.package-install }
        - { role: first_role }
        - { role: second_role }
